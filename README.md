# RoboticsIPBenchmark

## Installation and Usage

To install the MPCBenchmark package you need to type the following command in the root directory of this repository.

```shell
$ python -m pip install .
```

After a successfull install you will be able to run the basic test script to execute the Agents in an Environment.

```shell
$ python scripts/test.py
```

For further environments like the Mujoco ones you need to install the dependencies yourself.
There should be a wrapper already included for these types of environments.
