TODO:
-	Environments (separated from algorithms, gets input and changes environment in next state): 
  o	Inverted Pendulum 
  o	Cardpole Swing-Up (safer)
  o	Mountain Cart Continuous v0
  o	Inverted Double Pendulum
-	Algorithms = Agent:
  o	CEM
  o	MPPI
  o	iLQR
  o	i2c
-	Model (for a state and action predict next state), Agent (step -> take state and gives action) interfaces
-	Plots as separate Class => Give Parameters and plots automatically
